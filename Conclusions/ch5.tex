An evaluation of the project

\section{Discussion and Future Improvements}

Overall, this project achieved its aim of implementing an Attendance monitoring system that (does what it does). However, the uniqueness of this system can be extended.

Firstly by adding/integrating more tracking methods for different scenarios efficiency will no longer be a problem.
A QR code method that uses geo-location on the mobile application, that checks location before scanning QR code.

As much as RFID has a simpler implementation, it comes with a lot of limitations. It's easy to fool the system. In the near-future having a virtual NFC card just like bank cards in phones will be way more safer with respect to the system.

The timer on the website alongside with the allocated time from the database will be used to validate how long the class was held along other things.
