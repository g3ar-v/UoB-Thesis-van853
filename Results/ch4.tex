\chapter{Evaluation \& Discussion}
As stated in the Introduction, for an evaluation of this project we have to consider theses criterias. 

\section{Technical}

To track attendance with any of the referred methods,
to handle the exceptions of an unavailable internet or database connnection, to show results based on each attendance class. 
Since this system was based on 

\subsubsection{Features not implemented}

I did not implement the sign-in page and the login page,
I did not host the server on the internet.
I did not implement this for seperate lecturers although I have a database table with dummy data set for lecturers.
I could have implemented marking attendance using both fingerprint and RFID at the same time. 
A website page that adds users to the database with their rfid userID values and their fingerprint

\subsection{Challenges faced}
Having no knowledge on JavaScript it was an issue learning the concept of React and Node, and no idea of how a embedded devices communicate with each other.

\subsection{Lessons learnt}
There are a lot of implementations required on a webpage I went with the requirements for my prototype based on the time I had. 

\section{Results}
To test this system I created a dummy dataset for the database, the database is used to give an identity to the RFID tag or an individuals fingerprint. 
A really good aspect of this work is the ability for the administrator to have a remote access to the flask server therefore starting attendance for a system anywhere.

\section{Discussion and Future Improvements}

Overall, this project achieved its aim of implementing an Attendance monitoring system that (does what it does). However, the uniqueness of this system can be extended.

Firstly by adding/integrating more tracking methods for different scenarios efficiency will no longer be a problem.
A QR code method that uses geo-location on the mobile application, that checks location before scanning QR code.

As much as RFID has a simpler implementation, it comes with a lot of limitations. It's easy to fool the system. In the near-future having a virtual NFC card just like bank cards in phones will be way more safer with respect to the system.

The timer on the website alongside with the allocated time from the database will be used to validate how long the class was held along other things.

Having all these methods run concurrently, would be nice
Having multiple administrators use this system asynchronously.

An AI based recommendation to lecturers on what attendance tracking methods to be used based on the circumstances of the event.

More response systems other than the LED signals to really know understand the outcome of each reading, an LED screen with the name of the student, a sound for each outcome.
