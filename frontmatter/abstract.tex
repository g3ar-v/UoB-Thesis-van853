(problems)
For over four years in the University of Birmingham campus, I  have taken note of the attendance monitoring system, the inefficiency in tracking attendance in a Wide Area Network and it's causes, due to the number of users and the range (even with the boosters) of connectivity, Usually attendance in Birmingham is answered on canvas in a quiz form. Most of the time 
we can't access the internet and if we(users) don't have data we are unable to track. This prevents the 
university from tracking Lecture activities in the school.. There are more places like this with this inability to have a reliable internet connection and have issues with tracking attendance in monitoring system. I decided to develop an attendance system with a raspberry pi, a website, RFID and a Fingerprint module with Azure Cloud Computing Service where I designed and implemented a database and internet exception handler for this system that stores attendance data temporarily on the raspberry pi and sends it later on when there's internet access. This produced a system that is capable of tracking attendance in cases of short internet latency gaps given different options and tracking choices. It seems to curb the problems of not connecting to database by storing data temporarily on the raspberry-pi and sending it back up when the internet is on.

Being tested with large set of data this seems to fix
