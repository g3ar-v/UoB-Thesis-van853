For over four years in the University of Birmingham campus, I  have taken note of the attendance monitoring system, the inefficiency in tracking attendance  in a Wide Area Network and it's causes.There are more places like this with this inability to have a reliable internet connection and have issues with tracking attendance in monitoring system.


I decided to develop an attendance system with a raspberry pi, a website, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Devices) and a Fingerprint module with Azure Cloud Computing Service where I designed and implemented a database exception handler for this system 

This produced a system that is capable of tracking attendance in cases of short internet latency gaps given different options and tracking choices. It seems to curb the problems of not connecting to database by storing data temporarily on the raspberry-pi and sending it back up when the internet is on.



This has lead to (219 words)

Being tested with large set of data this seems to fix
